## Description

This is an application intended for developers to easily generate a README file based on their input into the command line. This application generates quality READMEs that follow best practices and include title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions sections. A badge for the selected license will appear below the title of the README, and the license section will include a link to the license the user has chosen. The questions section will also have a link to the user's GitHub profile based on their username that was inputted into the command line.

## Contributing

IMPORTANT NOTE: I used code that was supplied/corrected by the edX Xpert Learning Assistant as well as Google Gemini (as the Xpert Learning Assistant was down for a period of time while working on this assignment) in the Badge, License, and Questions sections of the README template, and all functions in the index.js and generateMarkdown.js files. Other guides and tutorials I used were https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide as well as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cgpu9L2AE8
